A simple mod that makes the Strange Dyes purchasable from the Dye Trader.

Dyes can be enabled in Pre-Hardmode and can have their prices set per-dye.

The Strange Dyes nearly fill the Dye Trader's inventory, meaning there's barely any slots left if another mod adds extra dyes.
I might come up with a solution for this in the future.
